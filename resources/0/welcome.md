## What is distributed computing?
Distributed computing is a way of combining multiple computers to solve a common problem. It transforms a computer network into a powerful single computer that provides large-scale resources to solve complex problems.

For example, distributed computing can encrypt large amounts of data; solve physical or chemical equations with many variables and output high-quality three-dimensional video animation. Distributed systems, distributed programming, and distributed algorithms are a few other terms related to distributed computing.

## What are the benefits of distributed computing?
Distributed systems have many advantages over computing on individual computers. Here are some examples:

### Scalability
Distributed systems can grow with increasing workloads and requirements. If necessary, you can add new nodes to distributed computing networks, that is, additional computing devices.

### Accessibility
Your distributed computing system will not fail if one of the computers fails. This structure is fault-tolerant because it can continue to operate even if a single computer fails.

### Consistency
Computers in a distributed system share information and store duplicate data, but the system automatically manages the integrity of the data across all the different computers. Therefore, you get the benefit of fault tolerance without compromising data consistency.

### Transparency
Distributed computing systems provide a logical separation between the user and physical devices. You can interact with the system as if it were a separate computer without having to worry about setting up and configuring individual computers. You can use a variety of hardware and software, middleware, and operating systems that will work together to keep the system running smoothly.

### Efficiency
Distributed systems provide increased performance and optimal use of the resources of the underlying software. As a result, you can manage any workload without worrying about ecosystem disruptions due to volume spikes or underutilization of expensive hardware.

## What are the use cases of distributed computing?
Distributed architectures are used everywhere today. Mobile and web applications are examples of distributed computing, as multiple computers work together to provide you with the right information. However, when distributed systems are scaled up vertically, they can solve more complex problems. Let's take a look at how different industries are using high-performance distributed applications.

### Healthcare & Life Sciences
In healthcare and life sciences, distributed computing is used to model and simulate complex biological data. Image analytics, drug research, and gene structure analytics have become faster thanks to distributed systems. Here are a few examples:

Accelerate structure-based drug design by visualizing molecular models in three dimensions.
Reduce genomic data processing time for early detection of cancer, cystic fibrosis, and Alzheimer's disease.
Developing intelligent systems that help doctors diagnose patients by processing large volumes of complex images such as MRI, X-rays, and CT scans.

### Engineering Studies
With distributed systems, engineers can simulate complex physical and mechanical concepts. They use these solutions to improve product design, create complex structures, and design faster vehicles. Here are a few examples:

Computational fluid dynamics investigates the behavior of fluids and implements these concepts in the designs of aircraft and racing cars.
Machine simulation requires simulation tools with advanced computing resources to test new products in manufacturing equipment, electronics, and consumer products.

### Financial Services
Companies in the financial services industry use distributed systems to perform high-speed economic simulations to assess portfolio risk, predict market trends, and support financial decision-making. They can build web-based applications that take advantage of distributed systems to achieve the following goals:

- Provision of personalized insurance premiums at low costs;
- Use of distributed databases to securely support a very large volume of financial transactions;
- User authentication and customer fraud protection.

### Energy and Ecology
Energy companies need to analyze big data to improve operations and transition to sustainable and climate-friendly solutions. They use distributed systems to analyze large streams of data coming from multiple sensors and other smart devices. Listed below are some of the tasks they can perform:

- Streaming and consolidation of seismic data for the structural design of power plants;
- Real-time monitoring of oil wells for proactive risk management.
## What are the different types of distributed computing architecture?
With distributed computing, you design applications that can run on multiple computers, not just one. This is achieved through software design in which different computers perform different functions and communicate with each other in order to obtain a final solution. There are four main types of distributed architecture.

### Client-server architecture
Client-server architecture is the most common way to organize a distributed system. Computers perform two roles: clients and servers.

#### Clients
The amount of information and computing capabilities of customers are limited. In doing so, they send requests to the servers that manage most of the data and other resources. You can send requests to clients, and they will contact the servers on your behalf.

#### Servers
Servers synchronize resources and manage access to them. They respond to customer queries by sending data or status information. Typically, a single server can handle requests from multiple computers.

#### Advantages and Limitations
The advantages of the client-server architecture are security and ease of ongoing maintenance. You only need to focus on protecting your servers. In addition, any changes to the database systems require changes only on the server.

A limitation of the client-server architecture is that servers can become a communication bottleneck, especially when multiple computers are sending requests at the same time.

### Three-tier architecture
In three-tier distributed systems, client computers remain in the first access layer. On the other hand, server computers fall into two more categories.

#### Application Servers
Application servers are the middle layer of communication. They contain the application logic or core functions that a distributed system is designed to perform.

#### Database servers
Database servers are the third layer where data is stored and managed. They are responsible for receiving data and its integrity.

By sharing responsibilities on the server, a three-tier distributed system reduces communication bottlenecks and improves distributed computing performance.

### N-layer architecture
N-tier models consist of several different client-server systems that interact with each other to solve the same problem. Most of today's distributed systems use an n-tier architecture, in which different enterprise applications work together behind the scenes as a single system.

### Peer-to-peer architecture
Peer-to-peer distributed systems assign the same responsibilities to all computers on the network. There is no separation into client and server computers, and any computer can perform all functions. Peer-to-peer architecture has become popular in content sharing, file streaming, and blockchain networks.

## How does distributed computing work?
In distributed computing, computers transmit messages to each other in a distributed systems architecture. Communication protocols or rules create dependencies between the components of a distributed system. This relationship is called interdependence. There are two main types of interdependence.

### Weak interdependence
In weak interdependence, the components are loosely connected, and changes in one do not affect the other.  For example, there may be a weak relationship between the client and the server in terms of time. Messages from the client are added to a queue on the server, and the client can continue to perform other functions until the server responds to its message.

### Strong interdependence
High-performance distributed systems often use strong interdependence. Fast LANs typically span multiple computers that make up a cluster. In cluster computing, all computers perform the same task. Central control systems, called cluster middleware, manage the execution of tasks, schedule them, and coordinate communication between different computers.

## What is parallel computing?
Parallel computing is a type of computing in which one or more computers on a network perform many calculations or perform many processes at the same time. Even though the terms parallel computing and distributed computing are often used interchangeably, there are some differences between the two.

### Parallel Computing and Distributed Computing
Parallel computing is a form of distributed computing with particularly strong interdependence. In parallel processing, all processors have access to shared memory to exchange information with each other. On the other hand, in distributed computing, each processor uses its own memory (distributed memory). Processors use message transmission to exchange information.

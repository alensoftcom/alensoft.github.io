# Task350. Data caching (using the example of **Redis**)

### Given:

- The system under development handles the entities **{{Author}}**, **{{News}}**, **{{Tag}}**, and **{{Comment}}**,
  that are logically related (see previous tasks)
    - one-to-many (**{{Author}}** and **{{News}}**, **{{News}}** and **{{Comment}}**)
    - many-to-many (**{{News}}**, **{{Tag}}**).
- Kafka is configured to pass between the publisher and discussion modules of the Comment}}** entity.
- **{{Author}}(s)**, **{{News}}(s)**, **{{Tag}}(s)** are stored in **Postgres**.
- **{{Comment}}(s)** are stored in **Cassandra**.

### Task

It is necessary to implement
caching mechanism in **Redis**.

The basis for completing the task is the following interaction diagram

### Technical requirements

- Use the **/api/v1.0/** prefix for REST controllers and their methods,
- Use the address and port of **localhost:24110** for the application itself (this is the **publisher** module).
- Do not disable the REST **localhost:24130** for the **discussion** module.
- Use the required **tbl_** prefix for the table(s) in the database(s)
- Use the default connection to **Redis** from [hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis)

### References

#### Learning Technology

1. Learn the basics of working with Redis and its features.
2. Understand the principles of data caching and how Redis can be used as a cache.
3. Learn the basic principles of horizontal scaling and how Redis helps with this.

#### Setting up and installing Redis

1. Download and install Redis on your local machine or use a cloud service.
2. Configure Redis according to project requirements.
3. Check the availability of Redis and make sure it works correctly.

#### Integration of Redis with the **publisher** module

1. Add a dependency to support Redis in the project.
2. Set up a connection to Redis from the **publisher** module.
3. Develop data caching logic in Redis for queries that require reuse.
4. Develop the logic for updating data in Redis and in the corresponding data stores for queries.

#### Testing and optimization

1. Write unit tests to check the correctness of the Redis-based cache.
2. Conduct load testing to evaluate the performance improvement of the REST module.
3. Optimize the Redis experience to reduce data access time.

### Additional steps (optional)

1. Implement logic to run additional instances of **publisher**
2. Check that the presence of a shared cache allows you to implement horizontal scaling of the **publisher** module

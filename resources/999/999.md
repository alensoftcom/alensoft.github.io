# And then?

Development options:

## 1. Updating modules **publisher** and **discussion** to the level of a full-fledged REST-Service

- Add pagination for queries to data collections:
  - Implement query parameters to specify page number and page size
  - Return metadata about the pagination in the response (e.g. total number of elements, number of pages, etc.)

- Implement a resource search mechanism in **publisher**:
  - Develop (or refine) endpoint(s) to perform search queries
  - Support filtering data by various fields (see the first paper)
  - Provide the ability to combine multiple search terms

- Implement support for HATEOAS (Hypertext As The Engine Of Application State) in **publisher**:
  - Add links to related resources in request responses
  - Use standard links to navigate between resources
  - Provide customers with the ability to identify and perform available actions through links

- Update API documentation with new functionality:
  - Describe query parameters for pagination and search
  - Give examples of using HATEOAS in answers
  - Update information on versioning and support for third-level readiness features
  - Automate the generation of documentation (for example, in the swagger format)

- Test changes:
  - Check pagination for large amounts of data
  - Check the correctness of the search mechanism with various criteria
  - Ensure that HATEOAS links are generated correctly and processed correctly by customers

## 2. Frontend and/or mobile client development.

- Choose a framework or library for frontend or mobile client development
  - Example: React.js for a web app or Flutter for a mobile app

- Set up a project with the selected development tool and connect the necessary dependencies

- Implement interface components for interacting with a REST service
  - Create forms to submit requests
  - Display the received data

- Create services or utilities to make HTTP requests to a REST service
  - Use Axios or Fetch API

- Process responses from the REST service and display the data in the user interface

- Add functionality for working with pagination, search queries, and HATEOAS
  - Implement a pagination mechanism
  - Add the ability to perform search queries
  - Support HATEOAS to navigate resources

- Test the interaction of the frontend or mobile client with the REST service on various devices and browsers

- Optimize application performance, taking into account the specifics of working with a REST service

## 3. Automated integration and unit testing

- Set up a tool to analyze code coverage **publisher** and **discussion** (using Jacoco as an example).
  - Add a Jacoco dependency to the project.
  - Configure your project build to generate code coverage reports based on 75% coverage.
- Write tests for a REST service.
  - Create test classes for each endpoint.
  - Write tests for various endpoint use cases.
- Run tests and collect code coverage data.
  - Run tests and collect code coverage data with Jacoco.
  - Generate a code coverage report for analysis.
- Analyze the results of code coverage.
  - Review the Jacoco report and identify areas of code that were not covered by tests.
  - Determine which tests need to be added or added to increase code coverage.
- Make adjustments to the tests and repeat the coverage analysis process.
  - Modify the tests to take into account the identified problem areas.
  - Rerun tests and collect code coverage data to evaluate improvements.
- Repeat the process of analyzing and adjusting tests to achieve the desired level of code coverage (75%).

## 4. Deploy an application to Docker Compose

- Create a docker-compose.yml file to describe the deployment of the publisher and discussion modules.
  - Prepare the publisher and discussion services for containerization.
  - Identify Redis, Kafka, Postgres, and Cassandra components.
- Configure the configuration of each service in docker-compose.yml.
  - Specify container images for publisher and discussion.
  - Specify container images for Redis, Kafka, Postgres, and Cassandra.
- Identify dependencies between services and components.
  - Make publisher and discussion dependent on Redis, Kafka, Postgres and Cassandra.
- Configure the parameters for connecting to the components in the docker-compose.yml.
  - Specify ports and environment variables for each component.
- Launch all services and components using Docker Compose.
  - Use the docker-compose up command to start all containers.
- Check the functionality of the publisher and discussion modules with components.
  - Ensure that data is transferred correctly between services and components.
- Stop and delete all containers after testing is complete.
  - Use the docker-compose down command to stop all containers.


## 5. Deploy the application to k8s

- Create manifests to deploy publisher and discussion instances to Kubernetes.
  - Define the configuration of containers, services, and other resources for each instance.
  - Specify the necessary parameters, such as container images, ports, and environment variables.
- Configure manifests to deploy databases and message brokers to Kubernetes.
  - Determine the types of components (in our case, PostgreSQL, Cassandra, Redis, Kafka).
  - Specify parameters for data storage, access, and configuration.
- Create manifests to configure the load balancer in Kubernetes.
  - Define the load balancer type (for example, Ingress, Service with the LoadBalancer type).
  - Specify the rules for routing traffic to services and the rules for starting or stopping them.
- Set up communication between services, brokers, and databases in Kubernetes.
  - Specify the connection parameters from the services.
  - Ensure secure data transfer between services, brokers, and databases.
- Test the deployed infrastructure in Kubernetes.
  - Run service availability tests through the load balancer.
  - Check the health of the connection between services and databases.
- Monitoring and maintenance of the deployed infrastructure in Kubernetes.
  - Set up monitoring of the status of services, databases, and the load balancer.
  - Provide mechanisms for data backup and disaster recovery.

## 6. Authentication and authorization for the *publisher* module

- Selection of authentication and authorization mechanisms
  - Determine which authentication and authorization methods will be used
  - Conduct a comparative analysis of solutions (JWT, OAuth, basic authentication).
- Integration of libraries or frameworks
  - Add the necessary libraries or frameworks to implement the selected authentication and authorization methods.
- Creation of a user system
  - Develop a user system with accounts, roles, and access rights.
  - Determine the type and method of retention of rights
- Implement authentication
  - Configure an authentication mechanism to authenticate users to requests to a REST service.
  - Deploy additional components as needed (example: Keycloak).
- Implementation of authorization
  - Establish an authorization mechanism to control access to various resources and operations in the REST service.
  - Configure additional components if necessary (example: Keycloak).
-Testing
  - Test the authentication and authorization functionality to ensure the correct operation and security of the system.
  - Automate authentication and authorization tests.
-Documentation
  - Document the configuration and implementation process of authentication and authorization for the *publisher* module with REST service.

## 1. Upgrading the publisher and discussion modules to a full-fledged REST service

###### Add pagination for queries to data collections:
  - Implement query parameters to specify page number and page size
  - Return metadata about the pagination in the response (e.g. total number of elements, number of pages, etc.)

###### Implement a resource search mechanism in **publisher**:
  - Develop (or refine) endpoint(s) to perform search queries
  - Support filtering data by various fields (see the first paper)
  - Provide the ability to combine multiple search terms

###### Implement support for HATEOAS (Hypertext As The Engine Of Application State) in **publisher**:
  - Add links to related resources in request responses
  - Use standard links to navigate between resources
  - Provide customers with the ability to identify and perform available actions through links

###### Update API documentation to reflect new functionality:
  - Describe query parameters for pagination and search
  - Give examples of using HATEOAS in answers
  - Update information on versioning and support for third-level readiness features
  - Automate the generation of documentation (for example, in the swagger format)

###### Test changes:
  - Check pagination for large amounts of data
  - Check the correctness of the search mechanism with various criteria
  - Ensure that HATEOAS links are generated correctly and processed correctly by customers

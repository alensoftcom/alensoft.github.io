## 3. Automated integration and unit testing

###### Set up a tool for code coverage analysis **publisher** and **discussion** (using Jacoco as an example).
  - Add a Jacoco dependency to the project.
  - Configure your project build to generate code coverage reports based on 75% coverage.
###### Write tests for a REST service.
  - Create test classes for each endpoint.
  - Write tests for various endpoint use cases.
###### Run tests and collect code coverage data.
  - Run tests and collect code coverage data with Jacoco.
  - Generate a code coverage report for analysis.
###### Analyze the results of code coverage.
  - Review the Jacoco report and identify areas of code that were not covered by tests.
  - Determine which tests need to be added or added to increase code coverage.
###### Make adjustments to the tests and repeat the coverage analysis process.
  - Modify the tests to take into account the identified problem areas.
  - Rerun tests and collect code coverage data to evaluate improvements.
###### Repeat the process of analyzing and adjusting tests to achieve the desired level of code coverage (75%).

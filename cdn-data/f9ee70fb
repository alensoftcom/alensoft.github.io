For the tests to work correctly, you need to update the program and/or keys.

Troubleshooting steps:
- Check that the correct keys are specified in the profile
- Check that the dates in the profile are correct
- Check the app's internet connection
- Restart the app
- If the previous steps did not help, then **update the application**:
	- **For Docker version (recommended)** via [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/khmelov/distcomp)
	- **For Desktop version** download the update [from here](https://bit.ly/poit-dist-comp)

If you have any difficulties, please contact the developer for more information
